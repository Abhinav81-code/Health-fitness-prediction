Project Drive Link :https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oR0jDFvyrW67RmbaRd_NveIlZTCaan2-?usp=drive_link 

📘 Overview
This project analyzes and predicts key health and fitness metrics using real-world activity tracking data. It includes a complete data analysis pipeline, Power BI dashboard for visual storytelling, and a Streamlit web app for interactive predictions.

📁 Project Files
Health_fitness.ipynb – Data preprocessing, EDA, and model building (Jupyter Notebook)

health tracker analysis.pbix – Power BI dashboard with health KPIs and visual insights

Streamlit/ – Streamlit app files for real-time health metric prediction

🎯 Objectives
Analyze health-related data (steps, sleep, heart rate, BMI, etc.)

Identify factors affecting calories burned and stress levels

Build predictive models for Calories_Burned and Fitness_Level

Deploy a Streamlit-based web app for user input and predictions

🔑 Key Features in Dataset (assumed from typical health trackers)
Age, Gender, Activity_Type, Duration, Intensity

Calories_Burned, Heart_Rate, Sleep, Stress, Steps, Hydration, BMI, Fitness_Level

📊 Components
📌 1. Jupyter Notebook (Health_fitness.ipynb)
